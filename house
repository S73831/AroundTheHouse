# AroundTheHouse
The first Unit 0 assignment for the AP CS50 class hosted by EdX. An essay below 400 words on a computing device in one´s house.

  Within my family household, laptops and smartphones are obviously classified as ¨computers¨, but there is a machine that
  is technically a computer. Namely, a CD player. 
  
  The device is relatively small, roughly smaller than the average printer and significantly lighter. The device has a top that
  when pressed down, opens, revealing an opening to place a CD in. It also comes with a radio antennae, a multi-input switch
  capable of turning the machine off, switching to CD, and local radio. A dial cos ntrolthe volume, and various buttons start and
  stop the music, or switches the current track on the CD.
  
  The CD player accepts data from either the current CD inserted into the device, or data from the nearest radio stations. Once
  further data is inputted from the buttons on the CD player, the CD or radio antennae processes the data given; usually through
  briefly spinning the CD, and begins to play audio based on the track number, CD, or radio, and at the defined volume.
